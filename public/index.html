<h1>Insights</h1>
<p>  After implementing my visualizations for Project 1, One thing I learned that I didn't learn from previous assignments was the importance of having to draw conclusions about the data that you are observing. <br/>
  If I don't make sense of the dataset that I have studied, I cannot convey information about it. On top of creating visualizations to see the data, you must also apply those visualizations to real situations. <br/>
  This critical skill is what makes this assignment worthwhile, and I feel that I have much to learn from here.
